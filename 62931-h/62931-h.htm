<h1 title="">THE BUBONIC PLAGUE.</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>WHAT IS IT?</i></span></h2>
<p>Any contagious and fatal epidemic disease was
originally called a plague (from <i>plaga</i>, a stroke),
but this term is now applied to that particular kind
of plague which is characterised by the appearance
of high fever with inflammation of lymphatic glands
or bubo, and is therefore called the Bubonic Plague.
In Sanskrit Medical Books it has been described as
<i>Vidradhi</i> and <i>Visharpa</i>, and in Yonani as <i>Taoon</i>.
The following definition given by Cantlie is comprehensive.
&ldquo;Plague or Malignant Polyadenites is
an acute febrile disease of an intensely fatal nature
characterised by inflammation of the lymphatic
glands, marked cerebral and vascular disturbances,
and by the presence of a specific bacillus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>ITS HISTORY.</i></span></h2>
<p>It is an ancient disease mentioned in Hindoo
and Christian Scriptures. Long before the Christian
era it prevailed in Greece, attacking the town of
Pir&aelig;us, where it raged for two years. Egypt, Syria,
Constantinople and Rome were visited by the plague.
In Constantinople the outbreak was once so furious
that during three months from 5,000 to 10,000
deaths occurred daily. The first historical allusion
to plague was made by Rufus, a physician who
lived in the reign of Trajan (A.D. 98-117), and
who mentions of glandular swellings. In 1347, plague
appeared in almost all countries in Europe, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Hecker believes, 25 millions of persons perished.
Ireland was visited by plague three hundred years
after its invasion by Patrolan, and it is said that
9,000 people died in a week and were buried at
Tallagh near Dublin&mdash;a name which means the
burial place of the plague-stricken. Plague visited
England frequently, and no fewer than eighteen
epidemics are said to have occurred before the great
plague of 1665. In 1720, 40,000 out of a population
of 90,000 died at Marseilles. In 1751, 150,000
died of plague in Constantinople. In 1799 the
French Army in Syria was devastated by plague.
6,000 persons died in Malta in 1813. In 1834-35,
14,888 persons died in Alexandria out of a population
of 42,000. In 1876 there was an outbreak
of the disease at Kumaon in Northern India, where
it prevailed several times during the present century,
and where it is known as the <i>Maha-Mari</i>.
It is also said that it prevailed in 1815 on the
Island of Kutch, and lasted till 1821 in Kutch and
Sindh. It also occurred between the years 1828
and 1838 in Jhansi, Bareilly, Pali and Jodhpore.
In China the plague has been present for a long
time in an epidemic form. In 1894 60,000 persons
died at Canton. From Canton it spread to Hongkong
and to Amoy. In 1895, it visited many places
in Southern China. In 1896, it was present at
Hongkong. Some people think that the disease
has come to Bombay probably from Singapore.
There was an epidemic at Merv when the Bombay
outbreak appeared, others, however, think that the
epidemic at Merv was not that of plague and that
the disease has come from Hongkong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>THE LONDON EPIDEMIC OF 1665.</i></span></h2>
<p>The following graphic and interesting account
of the great London Epidemic of 1665 is taken from
Sir William Guy&rsquo;s book on &ldquo;Public Health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now turn for a more exact account of the
plague of 1665 to the work of Dr. Nathaniel Hodges,
a Fellow of the College of Physicians, resident in
the City, and, as his book shows, in active practice
among the victims of the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Munk, in his roll of the Royal College
of Physicians of London, says that he &lsquo;acquired a
great name among the citizens of London; that he
remained at his post and continued in unremitting
attendance on the sick,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;during the latter
part of his life he received a regular stipend from
the City of London for the performance of his
charitable office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Hodges tells us that about the close of
1664, two or three persons died suddenly with
symptoms of the plague in one family at Westminster,
that some timid neighbours of theirs took
fright and removed into the City of London carrying
the taint of pestilence with them whereby the
disease, which existed only in a family or two, gained
strength and spread abroad, and &lsquo;for want of confining
the persons first seized with it, the whole
city was in a little time irrecoverably infected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In December a hard frost set in, which lasted
three months, and during that time very few died
of the plague. But the disease was not extinguished;
for, in the middle of the Christmas holidays, the
doctor was called to a young man in a fever, who
after two days &lsquo;had two risings about the bigness of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
a nutmeg,&rsquo; &lsquo;one on each thigh,&rsquo; with a &lsquo;black hue&rsquo;
and a &lsquo;circle round them.&rsquo; By these and subsequent
symptoms, he judged it to be a case of plague. It
did not prove fatal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the frost broke, the disease gained
ground and extended into several parishes; and
the authorities issued an order &lsquo;to shut up all the
infected houses,&rsquo; so as to prevent ingress and egress.
To give effect to this order, the houses of the infected
were to be marked with a red cross, and to
carry the inscription, &lsquo;<i>Lord have mercy upon us</i>,&rsquo;
and a guard was set whose duty it was to hand food
and medicine to the sick, and to prevent them from
going abroad till forty days after their recovery.
In spite of these harsh measures, &lsquo;the plague
more and more increased.&rsquo; Nor will this surprise
us if we imagine the frantic and successful efforts
that must have been made by the non-infected to
escape, and the temptation to servants and nurses
to appropriate and remove the property of the
dying and dead. Indeed, Dr. Hodges accuses the
nurses of strangling their patients, and secretly
conveying the pestilential taint from sores of the
infected to those who were well; and he justifies
his accusation of &lsquo;these abandoned miscreants,&rsquo; the
Gamps and Prigs of the seventeenth century, by
two instances; the one of a nurse who, &lsquo;as she
was leaving the house of a family, all dead, loaded
with her robberies, fell down dead under her burden
in the streets,&rsquo; the other of a &lsquo;worthy citizen&rsquo;
&lsquo;who, being suspected dying by his nurse, was
beforehand stripped by her; but recovering again,
he came a second time into the world naked.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of the well intentioned measures of
the authorities, the plague continued through May
and June with more or less severity, sometimes
in one place, sometimes in another, till the people
becoming thoroughly frightened, flocked out of
town in crowds. But the disease raged with redoubled
fury among those that remained. Then
the authorities bestirred themselves to the utmost.
They instituted a monthly fast; and the King commanded
the College of Physicians &lsquo;to write somewhat
in English,&rsquo; that might serve as &lsquo;a general
directory.&rsquo; The college not only obeyed the royal
commands, by inventing a &lsquo;<i>Plague Water</i>,&rsquo; consisting
of a cordial distilled off from a vinous infusion of
a score of very harmless roots, leaves, and flowers,
but also appointed two of their number to co-operate
with two chosen from among the aldermen
in attending the infected; while Dr. Glisson, Regius
Professor at Cambridge, and Drs. Paget, Wharton,
Berwick and Brookes volunteered their help, with
many others who survived, and eight or nine who
fell victims to their self-devotion, among whom
Dr. Conyers receives honourable mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, in the face of every precaution, the
plague continued its work of destruction, especially
among the common people, so as to be called the
&lsquo;<i>Poor&rsquo;s Plague</i>,&rsquo; and, in August and September,
completely got the mastery, &lsquo;so that three, four or
five thousand died in a week, and once 8,000.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I will follow Dr. Hodges&rsquo; example,
and try to give you some idea of the state of things
then prevailing. But in doing so I must shorten
and tone down his description. &lsquo;In some houses,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
he says &lsquo;carcases lay waiting for burial,&rsquo; &lsquo;in others,
persons in their last agonies.&rsquo; &lsquo;In one room might
be heard dying groans, in another the ravings of
delirium,&rsquo; and, near at hand, relations and friends
bewailing their loss and their own dismal prospects.
&lsquo;Death was the sure midwife to all children, and
infants passed immediately from the womb to the
grave.&rsquo; Some of the infected ran about staggering
like drunken men, and fell down dead in the streets,
or they lay there comatose and half dead; some
lay vomiting as if they had drunk poison; others
fell dead in the market in the act of buying provisions.
The plague spared &lsquo;no order, age or sex.&rsquo;
The divine was taken in the very exercise of his
priestly office, and the physician while administering
his own antidote; and though the soldiers retreated,
and encamped out of the city, the contagion
followed, and vanquished them. Many in
their old age, others in their prime, most women
and still more children, perished; &lsquo;and it was not
uncommon to see an inheritance pass successively
to three or four heirs in as many days.&rsquo; There
were not sextons enough to bury the dead, the bells
ceased tolling, the burying places were full, so that
the dead were thrown into large pits, dug in waste
ground, in heaps 30 or 40 together; and those who
attended the funerals of their friends one evening
were often carried the next to their own long home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is written of a time when the worst had
not yet happened. It was about the beginning of
September that the disease was at its height. Then
fires were ordered to be burnt in the streets for
three days together; but before the time had expired,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
they were extinguished by heavy rains, which
ushered in the most fatal night of all with its
register of more than 4,000 deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this, its culminating point, the plague,
&lsquo;by leisurely degrees declined,&rsquo; &lsquo;and before the
number infected decreased, its malignity began to
relax, insomuch that few died, and those chiefly such
as were ill-managed.&rsquo; Dr. Hodges distinctly states
that the pestilence did not stop for want of subjects,
but from the nature of the distemper. &lsquo;Its
decrease was, like its beginning, moderate.&rsquo; Early
in November, people grew more healthful, and
though the funerals were still frequent, &lsquo;yet many
who had made most haste in retiring, made the
most to return;&rsquo; &lsquo;insomuch that in December, they
crowded back as thick as they fled.&rsquo; The houses
were again inhabited; the shops re-opened; the
people went cheerfully to their work; the rooms,
in which a short time before infected persons had
breathed their last, were peopled afresh, and many
went into their beds &lsquo;before they were even cold
or cleansed from the stench of the diseased.&rsquo; &lsquo;They
had the courage now to marry again,&rsquo; &lsquo;and even
women, before deemed barren, were said to prove
prolific, so that, although the contagion had carried
off, as some computed, about 100,000, after a few
months, their loss was hardly discernable.&rsquo; But the
next spring there appeared &lsquo;some remains of the
contagion,&rsquo; which was easily conquered by the physicians;
and the whole malignity ceasing, the city returned
to perfect health, as after the great fire, &lsquo;a new
city suddenly arose out of the ashes of the old, much
better able to stand the like flames another time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.</i></span></h2>
<p>Plague is known in Europe, Asia and Africa,
but it has not been known in the Western Hemisphere.
It is said that Mesopotamia is the home
of plague. It has been known as far North as
Astrakhan in Asia and Norway in Europe. During
the last fifty years, however, it is chiefly confined
to Asia from Red Sea on one side, and the shores
of the Pacific on the other. Some are inclined to
think that the plague was carried from Himalyan
India across Thibet to Yanon in Chinese territory,
thence to Pekoi whence it made its way to Canton
and Hongkong. If that be so, then the plague has
accomplished a tour from Northern India <i>vi&acirc;</i> China
by Sea route to Southern India within a period of
twenty years between 1876 and 1896.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>CAUSES</i>&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>A disease so fatal in its nature and against
which human power is so futile was in ancient
times naturally attributed to wrath of the gods.
Supernatural, astrological, and, in some instances,
rationalistic causes were assigned to it. In the
fourteenth century the College of Physicians of
Paris ascribed it to the influence of constellations
in India. But more natural explanations, however,
gradually followed. Putrefaction of dead animals
was assigned as a cause in Egypt. Poisoning of
water-supply was also believed to be the cause.
Undue heat, rain, watery grain, and absence of the
Etesian winds were thought to generate plague.
Leaving ancient theories on the causation of the
disease we find that modern Scientists divide themselves
into two classes: <i>first</i>, those who believe in
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the germ theory and attribute the plague to a
specific germ, holding that germs can never arise
<i>de novo</i>; <i>second</i>, those who believe that atmospheric
changes and certain telluric conditions or
insanitary surroundings engender the seeds of
pestilence which are carried through air, water or
other media. The arguments in favour of the first
theory are, however, so strong and overwhelming,
that it is now almost universally accepted that
plague is due to a specific poison which grows and
multiplies under favourable conditions, and that
wherever it occurs it is caused by the implantation
of those germs in a suitable soil. If the soil is
not fit, the germs may be sown, but they will not
germinate and, if the soil is fit but the germs are
absent, the disease will not be seen. The soil best
suited for the plague seed is one where insanitary
conditions prevail. Dirt and filth, bad ventilation,
and overcrowding are its manure. The history of
plague from ancient times fully illustrates that
plague thrives in dirt, filth, squalor and misery.
Diseased grain and want of subsoil drainage are
held to be potent factors in the diffusion of plague.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>BACILLUS</i>&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>During the Hongkong epidemic the great Japanese
bacteriologist Kitasato, who formerly worked
with Koch in Germany, discovered a bacillus in
plague-stricken patients, and showed by experiments
that these bacilli if injected into lower animals produced
in them symptoms of plague. Yersin simultaneously
discovered the same germs in connection
with plague. According to our modern notion of
the causation of the disease, these germs must be
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
considered to be the specific poison which produces
the symptoms of plague. The bacilli are found in
the blood, in the buboes, and in all internal organs
of the victim of the plague. They are short rods
with rounded ends, with a clear space or band in
the centre, readily stained by the aniline dyes and
showing very little power of movement. The size
of the plague bacillus varies, and bacilli of same
character, but of less virulent nature, have been
found in the soil of infected places. Some bacteriologists
observed some development after death in the
bacilli, this, if confirmed by observations at Bombay,
will be highly interesting from a bacteriological point
of view. If mice, rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits are
inoculated with the plague bacillus, they soon become
infected and die, and in their internal organs the
same bacilli are found. They are also found in the
soil and dust of houses where plague patients were
kept, but not invariably so. Kitasato found the
bacilli in the blood of patients convalescing from an
attack of plague even three or four weeks after
all symptoms have disappeared. It has been found
that the bacillus dies after four days, during which
it is kept at a dry heat, or at the temperature of
80&deg;C. or 176&deg;F. for half an hour, or at that of 100&deg;
C or 212&deg;F. for a few minutes. Its resisting power to
chemical disinfectants is feeble, dying in a 1 per cent.
solution of carbolic acid or of lime water. It develops
easily in many culture media at the ordinary
temperature (from 18&deg; to 22&deg;C). An alkaline solution
of Peptone 2 per cent., with from 1 to 2 per
cent. of gelatine, is the best nutrient medium for
its cultivation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>CONTAGIOUS AS WELL AS INFECTIOUS.</i></span></h2>
<p>Experience has proved that plague can be
transmitted from one person to another by direct
contact; when a case of plague occurs in a house,
other inmates of the house are much liable to be attacked
also. Visitors to the house, medical and other
attendants are also liable to be seized or to carry
with them fresh focus of infection. It was, however,
found in the Hongkong epidemic of 1894 that none
of the European medical men, some fifteen in
number, nor any of the Chinese students who were
on duty at the plague hospital died. During the
Egyptian epidemic of 1835 a French doctor, Bulard,
with the courage of his conviction that plague was
not contagious wore the shirt of a patient who died
from plague, and yet did not contract the disease.
Such immunity, however, was probably due to some
circumstances which might be easily explained. In
the Hongkong epidemic of 1894 three Japanese
medical men contracted the disease, and in 1896,
some European nurses were attacked. In Bombay
the sad deaths of Surgeon-Major Manser and Miss
Joyce prove that contagion plays an important part
in the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>It has been maintained that plague is a miasmatic
or soil-bred disease, and that the germs find
in earth, water or in some form of fermenting or
decomposing material a suitable nidus for growth.
In this sense it is like malaria, which is endemic
in a particular suitable area appearing and disappearing
according as climatic or other conditions
are favourable or unfavourable. The Chinese
have a peculiar idea of the infection of plague.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
They consider that the plague rises from the soil and
believe that it first attacks small animals with breathing
organs near the soil, such as rats, then animals
with breathing organs a little higher, such as poultry,
pigs, dogs, goats, cows, so on till it reaches man,
whose breathing organs are higher from the soil than
those of other animals.</p>
<p>The rats are undoubtedly attacked with plague
before and during its prevalence among human
beings, and they play an important part in the spread
of its infection. In Kumaon this rat plague was
observed by the people, and was recognized as a
forerunner of the plague. The <i>Times of India</i>,
September 30th, 1896, contains the following:&mdash;&ldquo;It
was known more than a month ago to all the
people of Mandavi and to all the municipal sweepers
in the district that the rats were dying in
thousands all over the districts. They were found
dead and dying almost everywhere, and in places
where dead rats were never found before.&rdquo; In
Bombay an instance has been reported of a man
trampling with bare foot on a rat which was
seen slowly passing in a room and getting attacked
by the plague soon after. Pigs, dogs, snakes,
and jackals are said to be also affected by the plague.
It will be seen that flesh-eating animals are the
sufferers, due evidently to their eating plague flesh.
Snakes swallow rats, and rats become infected by
consumption of poisoned material or from infected
soil or by their cannibal habit. Like other diseases
due to a specific germ, the infection of plague may
be caught from various sources such as the following&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
By means of breath. Plague dust and dirt
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
are very potent infective agents. A man getting
a whiff of dust from the floor of a room in which
there is a plague patient blown into his face may
get the infection. Sweepers and others engaged in
conservancy are, therefore, easily attacked. (<i>b</i>) By
food or drink. Grain adultered with sand or earth
infected by rats may be a source of infection. Food
may also be infected by flies or diseased rats (<i>c</i>) By
direct inoculation through any abrasion in the skin
or mucous membrane. People with bare feet are,
therefore, more liable to catch the infection. The
infection may be spread by infected linen, bedding,
furniture and fomites. The discharge from buboes
contains the germs, and is, therefore, highly poisonous.
The f&aelig;ces, the urine, the sputum, the fur on the
tongue are also infective. If the theory be true that
the poison attaches itself to the soil, then persons
living on ground-floor are more liable to the infection,
and a floating population less so. Dust laden
with germs is the principal agent in the diffusion of
plague as that of any other germ disease. Professor
Aoyama of Tokyo, whilst making a <i>post-mortem</i> examination,
scratched the left third finger and was
attacked with the plague, also Dr. Ishigami, assistant
to Kitasato.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>NATURE OF AN EPIDEMIC.</i></span></h2>
<p>Plague is a very slow disease; it takes some
weeks to travel from one quarter of a city to
another. It took nine months to travel from the
city of London to Soho, and ten from Hongkong
to Macao&mdash;a distance of 30 miles. Thousands of
persons from Canton and Hongkong sought shelter
at Macao, and there was free communication between
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
these places, still Macao became affected nine months
after plague ceased at Hongkong. When plague
is first imported in a place, for three or four weeks
isolated cases occur in one neighbourhood. An
epidemic may last only a few weeks or months, but
may extend over several years in sporadic form and
a recrudescence takes place abruptly. In Mesopotamia
plague declines and becomes dormant with
the setting in of the hot weather, its activity reawakening
in winter and gathering force with the
advancing spring. The same was the case in
Egypt. In Constantinople, on the contrary, as well
as in England, the disease was dormant during the
cold months but became active during the hotter.
In England, September was the month of greatest
prevalence. In the epidemic at Bengazi in 1858
as well as in Mukai in 1863 famine and plague
were found together. That a water-logged soil
favours famine was illustrated during the epidemic
on the Lower Euphrates in 1867. In Persia and
Arabia many epidemics were self-limited and spontaneously
came to an end after spreading on a certain
area, while, on the other hand, it has been known to
obtain an endemic foot-hold, the virus remaining
from year to year, and, occasionally under the influence
of meteorological or unknown causes, becoming
epidemic among the population.</p>
<p><i>Race.</i>&mdash;No race seems to enjoy an immunity
from the plague.</p>
<p><i>Geology and Climate.</i>&mdash;Except the new hemisphere
the plague has found congenial soil everywhere.
It thrives as much in high and dry altitudes
as in low-lying places, as much in overcrowded
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
towns as in sparsely populated semi-desert
regions. In temperate regions it has been known
to rage in summer, but in Astrakhan it prevailed
when there were several feet of snow on the ground.
On the Volga it prevailed during the severest cold
(1878-79), as well as in the extreme heat of Smyrna
(1735). In Bombay it commenced at the end
of an exceptionally dry season, as it did in South
China. During the Hongkong epidemic the rains
increased it. The increase of the epidemic at
Hongkong with the rains was probably due to the
fact that the rains drove people into infected houses,
instead of sleeping outside, as they did in summer
when the weather was good. It has been said that
plague flourishes in a warm moist atmosphere and
dry hot air kills it, but there are records of plague
thriving in conditions antagonistic to this theory.
A temperature between 60&deg; and 85&deg;F. is said to be
very favourable to it.</p>
<p><i>Sex and Age.</i>&mdash;Both sexes are equally liable.
It is said that people between the ages of 10 to 30
are frequently attacked. But experience shows
that children and old people are alike liable to
attack. In Bombay the disease has occurred most
frequently between the ages of 20 and 30, and the
male sex has suffered more than the female.</p>
<p><i>Occupation.</i>&mdash;During one epidemic, water-carriers,
or those who used much water, or who dealt
in oil and fats were found comparatively free; but
this observation cannot be relied upon. Those
whose business requires them to come much in contact
with the sick, and also those who are engaged
in cleaning are naturally more exposed to infection.
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
It has been said that one attack generally protects
from a second, which, if it occurs, usually runs a
mild course.</p>
<p><i>Sanitation and Personal Hygiene.</i>&mdash;Plague,
germs thrive in filth. Bad hygienic conditions,
over-crowding, insufficient ventilation, and absence
of sunlight in dwelling houses, accumulation of
decomposing organic matter, effluvia from bad
drains, sewer and cesspools are causes that favour
the growth and dissemination of an epidemic
of plague. When it attacks a town, it, therefore,
naturally selects first the poorer classes who live in
ill-ventilated and over-crowded houses. Over-crowding
within dwelling houses is a fertile source of
producing a constitution fitted for the reception of
plague-germs. Such portions of towns where there
is much congestion and over-crowding suffer most.
Scarcity of food favours plague. It has been called
<i>Miseri&aelig; Morbus</i>, or the disease of misery, and the
plague of London was called the &ldquo;poor&rsquo;s plague.&rdquo;
In Kumaon there is the usual custom of keeping
cattle in the lower room of a hut, where a crowd of
cattle stand udder deep in f&oelig;tid straw. In one of
the rooms of the upper storey grain is kept, and in
another the whole family sleeps with doors and windows
shut. Such conditions are undoubtedly very
favourable to plague.</p>
<p><i>Predisposition.</i>&mdash;Chill and exposure to cold,
indigestion and any other disease producing a debilitated
condition of body, fatigue, overwork, error
of diet, mental emotion, and a terror of attack are
predisposing causes. Catarrhs often predispose an
attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>INCUBATION.</i></span></h2>
<p>Or how long does it take for the poison to
develop symptoms after infection: generally three
to six days, but the period may be up to ten days.
The period varies with the virulence of the poison.
The germs, however, remain active outside a host
for a long time. An instance has been reported,
in which a man, after handling some ropes which 20
years previously had been used in the burial of
plague corpses, took the disease and died of it.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>SYMPTOMS.</i></span></h2>
<p>The usual premonitory symptoms are headache,
loss of appetite, a feeling of general depression and
aching of limbs. These symptoms may either be
mild or may appear at once in very aggravated
form; violent headache being usually of an acute
dull character, accompanied by throbbing in the
temples, giddiness, sleeplessness, palpitation, a feeling
of oppression of the chest, even mental delusion
may appear on the first day. The look of the
patient is anxious, pale and cyanosed. The expression
of the face resembles that of a man who has
had no sleep for two or three nights but is being
overpowered with the fatigue consequent to it.
These symptoms are usually ushered in with a rise
in the temperature. Well-marked rigor is usually
not seen, but a slight shiver or chillness is complained
of. Pulse is full, bounding and rapid&mdash;130 or more
per minute. Respiration is difficult and accelerated
even to 40 or 50 per minute. Skin is dry and hot,
face puffed, conjunctiv&aelig; congested. Sense of hearing
is dull. Speech is thick and faltering. Tongue
is dry and coated with greyish white or dark
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
brown heavy fur. Violent thirst is present. Sometimes
Patchi&aelig; appear on the skin. In a few
hours, or a few days after the appearance of the
first symptoms, a swollen gland appears either in
the neck or axilla or groin. The gland most commonly
affected is one or some of the femoral chain.
An inguinal, axillary or a cervical gland may also be
affected. A number of glands may swell at one
time or glands in all the above situations may be
felt painful and swollen. The glands of the neck
are most frequently attacked in children. Pains
in the lower part of the abdomen and along the
spine indicate affection of internal lymphatic glands.
In some cases the first symptom noticed is a
swollen and painful gland, but fever soon manifests
itself. The glandular enlargement may antedate,
coincide with, or follow the rise in temperature.
Sometimes only pain in the gland is complained
of, but no swelling is observed. The
temperature rises gradually and goes up to 104&deg;,
105&deg; or 106&deg; F. In some cases a temperature of
108&deg; was observed. There may be a marked morning
fall and an evening exacerbation, which is a
favourable sign, or the temperature may remain
high persistently. All the above symptoms become
soon aggravated when the second stage or stage
of acute development of the disease appears. Brain
symptoms show themselves. Lowson noticed four
distinct type of brain symptoms&mdash;(1) comatose,
when the patient lies paralysed, mind and body; (2)
wildly delirious, when the patient struggles and
fights and still retains a fair command of rational
speech; (3) apathetic, when he lies perfectly quiet
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
but is drowsy; (4) convulsive, which condition
occurs when there is inflammation of the meninges
or h&aelig;morrhage in the brain.</p>
<p>In this stage all symptoms of a pronounced
typhoid condition supervene. Tongue becomes
parched and black. Sordes cover the teeth. Gradually
a somnolent condition and low muttering
delirium supervene. In some cases the delirium
is violent and furious, while in others it culminates
in complete stupor and coma. Picking of the bed-clothes,
and subsultus tendinum are common, and
the urine and f&aelig;ces are passed involuntarily. The
pupils are dilated. The skin is bathed with profuse
perspiration. The pulse is dichrotic and compressible,
and gradually becomes anachrotic and
intermittent till it finally fails. The area of cardiac
dullness is increased and pain in the cardiac region
is complained of. Heart begins to fail rapidly.
The usual complications of this stage are&mdash;(1)
meningites; (2) h&aelig;morrhages; (3) severe gastric
disturbance, such as vomiting, diarrh&oelig;a, hiccough.
As a rule, constipation is found during the course
of an attack, but diarrh&oelig;a, even severe, may appear.
There may be pain in the abdomen. Bladder may
be distended and a catheter may be necessary
to evacuate it. Cystitics often develop. &OElig;dema
of the lungs, pleurisy and pneumonia may also
complicate a case. H&aelig;maturia, h&aelig;moptysis and
h&aelig;matemesis may be seen. Bronchitis and hypostatic
inflammation may occur. The urine always
shows presence of albumen. Death may take place
from cardiac failure or from any of the above
complications. Death may take place within three
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
or four days, though in some virulent cases the
patient dies within twenty-four hours. If the primary
collapse is tided over, there is great chance
of recovery, still deaths often occur of complications
several days after the attack.</p>
<p>In mild cases the second stage is not so severe,
and temperature may fall by lysis or crisis&mdash;the
latter being rare.</p>
<p>The glands in the meantime become swollen
and are surrounded by a sero-sanguinous exudation.
The surrounding parts are &oelig;dematous. The glands
usually do not suppurate, but they may do so and
slough. The usual course after their enlargement is
one of four: (1) resolution; (2) lengthened period
of enlargement; (3) suppuration; (4) sloughing.
In cases that recover the symptoms gradually take
a favourable turn and recovery is as rapid as the
attack. The fever slackens, the pulse becomes
stronger, the tongue moist and the typhoid symptoms
gradually pass away. The buboes either suppurate
or subside; symptoms of secondary pyaemic
conditions, however, may sometimes develop. Deviations
from the typical course are, however, often
observed. Some cases take an extremely rapid
course, the patient succumbing within from 12 hours
to two days. The duration of the disease varies
between a few hours and a few weeks, but on an
average up to the commencement of the convalescence
it seems to last from 6 to 10 days. During
convalescence the vitality of the issues are very low.
Head symptoms sometimes persist for some time.
Temper is irritable. The sloughing glands often take
a long time to heal. Convalescence is soon established.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>VARIETIES.</i></span></h2>
<p>Just as before an epidemic of cholera visits a
place, it is usual to observe cases of mild diarrh&oelig;a,
and indigestion prevailing amongst its population;
so, before plague actually breaks out, it has been
found that cases of buboes and parotites with fever
are commonly observed. Such cases were called
<i>Pestis Minor</i> at Astrakhan. &ldquo;No one died from the
disease <i>per se</i>, but few people were confined to bed.&rdquo;
It is not known whether in <i>pestis minor</i> the plague
germs could be found; but presumably not.</p>
<p>Drs. Simpson and Cobb of Calcutta have described
what is called <i>Pestis Ambulans</i>, or an ambulatory
form of plague, in which plague germs have
been found. The commonly accepted types of
plague are (1) Fulminant; (2) Typical; (3) <i>Pestis
Minor</i> (including <i>ambulans</i>). The cause of the
first two is the bacillus discovered by Kitasato, and
they are very fatal, of the third, the cause may be
an allied bacterium less potent to produce toxic
effects on man, and it may come and go but plague
may not break out. In ambulatory form the patient
has slight fever and glandular enlargement, but he
can move about.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>DIAGNOSIS</i>&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>It is difficult to differentiate a case of true
plague in its early stages from a case of fever with
benign glandular swellings or mumps. The premonitory
symptoms of plague, and even the early
symptoms of the first stage, may be due to many
different diseases and therefore great caution is
needed. It is needless to say how important it is
that such diagnosis should be done with great care,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
specially when plague cases have to be isolated, for
if a case of simple fever with benign lymphadenitis
be brought in close contact with patients suffering
from true plague, it is a serious matter with the
former. A venereal bubo, or scrofulous enlargement
of glands, or enlargement of femoral or inguinal
gland due to traumatic or other causes which
may be attended with fever should not be mistaken
for a plague symptom. A medical man who has,
however, carefully observed the facies of a few
cases of true plague, and who carefully takes into
consideration all other probable conditions which
may be mistaken for plague, may not commit a
mistake, but its probabilities are to be borne in
mind. The practical lesson is, that all doubtful
cases should be isolated and kept separate from
cases of pronounced type. The plague bears some
resemblance to typhus. Murchison says: &ldquo;Plague
is perhaps the typhus of warm climates, the two
diseases being generated from similar causes and
differing only in intensity from the effects of
climate and other collateral circumstances.&rdquo; In
typhus there is a characteristic rush, and in plague
there is bubo, but this order of things have been
found in some instances to have changed, there
being eruption in plague and bubo in typhus. The
two diseases are, however, different and bacteriological
and clinical evidence corroborate this view.
Cantlie adds another disease, which he says he
mistook for plague:&mdash;&ldquo;On June 26th, 1894, when
the plague was at its height, I saw a Parsee patient
dwelling in a house in which plague existed, suffering
from fever 104&deg;(F.), dry tongue, headache,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
backache and large swollen glands in the left groin,
which had suddenly appeared. Plague seemed the
only diagnosis, and the man, much against his will,
was sent to the plague hospital. In two days he
came back again quite well, and on examining him
I found his urine thick and milky. That night I
found filaria in the man&rsquo;s blood, and knew I had
made a mistake in the first instance. Of course,
the mistake is most likely to happen, but nevertheless
it is not pleasant to think that we had subjected
the man to the terrible danger of plague infection.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>PROGNOSIS.</i></span></h2>
<p>The mortality from plague may be about 90 per
cent. or more when the epidemic is at its height. In
the beginning, or towards the end of the epidemic, the
mortality is less, as it is the case with all other epidemic
diseases. The average mortality at Bombay
has been 84 per cent. and in Karachi 89 per cent.
It is, therefore, more fatal than all other epidemic
diseases, the mortality from cholera during the
height of an epidemic being about 60 per cent.</p>
<p>In children and in the aged the disease is
more fatal than in healthy adults. Cases in which
the bubo appears early and is single, or in which
there is a distinct morning remission, or less general
prostration or free perspiration, or in which there is
no diarrh&oelig;a, have greater chance of recovery.
Rapid suppuration of the buboes indicates a favourable
termination. Buboes do not suppurate as a
rule until the primary fever has fallen. On the
other hand, carbuncles, multiple buboes (specially
on the neck), meningitis, h&aelig;morrhages, pleurisy,
pneumonia, diarrh&oelig;a, gastric irritation, cyanosis,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
jaundice and continued pyrexia are unfavourable
signs.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>MICROSCOPIC AND MACROSCOPIC APPEARANCES.</i></span></h2>
<p>Bacilli are found in all the internal organs,
notably in the spleen, in blood and in the enlarged
glands.</p>
<p>Body does not show much emaciation; decomposition
commences early. Black h&aelig;morrhagic
patches are often found on the skin. The brain and
membranes are congested. Sanguinous or serous
effusions are found in serous cavities. Right side of
the heart is dilated and is usually found full of
coagulated or liquid blood. Cardiac muscles pale.
The liver is enlarged and congested. The spleen is
much enlarged, soft and congested. H&aelig;morrhagic
patches have been found in the stomach. The
mesenteric glands are enlarged. Kidneys congested.
Bladder is sometimes found filled with bloody
urine. The buboes are sometimes found to be soft
and caseous. The tissues surrounding them are infiltrated
with a reddish gelatinous exudation. The
whole lymphatic chain from groin to the glands of
the sacral or lumbar plexus, or from the axilla and
neck to the glands of the mediastinum are affected.
The internal glands are found more or less enlarged,
injected and infiltrated with sanguineous fluid. The
lymphatic follicles and Peyer&rsquo;s patches in the intestines
are found swollen. H&aelig;morrhages are found
in the mesentery.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>PREVENTION.</i>&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>It is evident from what has been said that to
prevent plague our efforts should be directed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
two ways:&mdash;(1) To prevent the importation of
germs; (2) to make the environment of a place
such that the germs, even if imported, may not find
suitable condition for their growth. To accomplish
the first we need (<i>a</i>) inspection of people coming
from infected places; (<i>b</i>) stopping importation of
such articles as may carry infection with them; (<i>c</i>)
quarantine, a word which owes its origin to the fact
that, daring the epidemic of plague at Milan in
1527, patients when cured were despatched to
lazarettos and detained there 40 days.</p>
<p>For the second, we require (<i>a</i>) sanitary precautions
by guardians of public health; (<i>b</i>) observance
of rules of personal hygiene by which good
health can be maintained.</p>
<p>(1). Wherever possible a medical inspection
should be made to prevent importation of the disease.
This is, however, a very difficult matter, and one
unforeseen difficulty was experienced at Sukkur,
where it was found that people booked to stations
short of Sukkur, and rebooked at stations on the
other side. Still this measure is highly important,
and should be carried out most rigorously as long as
there is any chance of importation of plague into an
unaffected country. It is needless to feel the pulse
of the patient; his gait, temperature, and look would
afford a great deal of information. Information
should be obtained from where the patient is
travelling. An examination should also be made of
clothes. Dirty clothes, soiled linen and rags should
not be allowed to pass through an inspection post.</p>
<p>(2). There should be a disinfecting or sterilizing
room fitted with a steam sterilizer in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
large railway stations, where all goods should be
disinfected. Mail bags should also be subjected to
this disinfection. Transmission of such goods as
corpses, used clothes, rags, waste paper, fur, hide,
feather, and fish should be entirely suspended.</p>
<p>(3). If quarantine is imposed, it should be for
a period not less than ten days. Every arrangement,
however, should be made for suitable accommodation
and sanitation in quarantine camps. In a
quarantine camp new arrivals should not be mixed
up with those who are already in quarantine.</p>
<p>(4). Ships from infected ports should be carefully
watched. If any infection is discovered, then
isolation of the sick, disinfection of the ship and
quarantine are required, but ships with clean bills of
health, and if ten days have passed since its departure
from the infected port, may be admitted after
medical inspection. It must, however, be borne in
mind that rats could easily carry infection from one
port to another without any fear of detection.
These facts show that medical inspection and quarantine
may be useful, but they can never be perfect,
and therefore the principal safeguard of a place
lies in the improvement of its sanitation, and therefore
greater attention and energy should be directed
towards it.</p>
<h3 id="c16"><i>Sanitary Measures that should be taken by Municipal and Railway authorities.</i></h3>
<p>(1). All filth should be removed from the
vicinity of towns and villages and <i>burnt</i>, and no
filth of any kind should be allowed to remain within
an inhabited area for any length of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>(2). All private and public latrines and public
urinals should be cleaned and disinfected daily. All
receptacles used for night-soil either in the latrine
or for transport should be daily disinfected.</p>
<p>(3). Latrine accommodation, according to the
requirements of the population, should be provided.</p>
<p>(4). Drains should be well washed and
flushed with a disinfectant solution. In towns
where there is an underground sewer, it should be
well flushed and ventilated, and a disinfectant solution
used for cleaning it. A house-to-house examination
should be made to ascertain that all house-connections
are properly and efficiently trapped.
Deposits in the sewer should be taken out and
suitably disposed off after disinfection.</p>
<p>(5). Special attention for cleansing should
be given to the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Cesspools, privies, cow-houses, stables, slaughterhouses,
markets, workshops, common lodging houses,
serais, bustees, and crowded quarters of a town.</p>
<p>(6). All public roads should in the dry season
be watered with a weak disinfectant solution.</p>
<p>(7). Pure drinking water should be supplied.
All articles of food should be inspected. Musty
and decomposing grains should not be allowed to be
sold. The meat market, dairies and bakeries should
be under strict sanitary supervision.</p>
<p>(8). Over-crowding in houses should be prevented.
Steps should be taken for spreading out
the population of much over-crowded and congested
parts of towns.</p>
<p>(9). Lime in a dry state and in solution should
be abundantly used in drains, &amp;c.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>(10). All railway carriages travelling through
infected areas should be daily washed with a
reliable disinfectant solution, such as 5 per cent.
carbolic acid.</p>
<p>(11). Railway platforms, waiting rooms and
halls, and latrines should be frequently cleaned and
disinfected.</p>
<p>(12). There should be a system of house-to-house
inspection to ascertain the sanitary condition
of dwelling-houses, and also to find out, as far as
possible, the condition of health of the inmates.</p>
<p>Common lodging houses, serais and houses of
a similar nature should be most carefully examined.</p>
<p>(13). If plague breaks out, then isolation of
cases is a great necessity. When practicable, such
isolation may be done in the house of the patient.
The patient should be kept in a separate room apart
from those where other inmates of the house live.
A temporary room could be put up on the roof of a
house or in the compound, if there is any, or a tent
may be pitched. Where possible, all healthy inmates
of the house should at once remove themselves
in camp leaving only such near relatives who
must attend and nurse the patient. For patients
living in lodging houses, or, where there is no means
of such isolation as stated above, segregation in
special isolation hospitals should at once be done.
The isolation hospitals should be separate for each
of the following classes&mdash;(<i>a</i>) for lower class people;
(<i>b</i>) for middle class people; (<i>c</i>) for such people
of the middle or upper class who may chose to pay
for their expenses. It is needless to say that there
should be special hospitals for women, where only
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
female attendants and nurses should be employed.
Hospitals should be provided with means for free
ventilation, both for the sake of patients as well as
attendants. No other disease requires more careful
nursing than the plague, therefore ample nursing
staff should be provided. The hospitals should
have a separate observation ward and a separate
convalescent ward, and by no means doubtful cases
should be mixed up with confirmed cases. Disinfecting
apparatus, sterilizers, good water supply and
special laundry are other adjuncts essentially necessary
for a plague hospital. Greatest care is required
in the management of such a hospital, and only
trained men should be employed.</p>
<p>Suitable means for ambulance should be provided,
and should be had ready within convenient
distances. They should be thoroughly disinfected
after the conveyance of any case. Ambulance carts
or doolies should be comfortable, for physical exertion
and exhaustion, attending a long journey in the
early stage, greatly compromise chance of recovery.</p>
<p>Burial within inhabited areas of a town
or village should be stopped. Dead bodies should
be removed under strict precautions for disinfection
and disposed off quickly. Bodies should be
buried deeply&mdash;4 to 6 feet.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>PRIVATE HYGIENE.</i></span></h2>
<p>I. Houses and compounds, stables, kitchen and
outhouses should be thoroughly cleaned, and they
should be whitewashed with lime. Air-tight dustbins
should be kept in the house.</p>
<p>II. Rooms, specially bed-rooms, should be well
ventilated, attention should be paid to the condition
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
of the floor, which should not be damp, and care
should be taken that rats may not infest the house
and spaces under the floor. If dead rats are found
in the house, they should be removed and burnt, and
the place thoroughly disinfected.</p>
<p>III. House drains should be cleaned and well
flushed with a disinfectant solution.</p>
<p>IV. Nowhere in the house or compound should
any kind of organic refuse be allowed to accumulate.
Better not use any organic manure in the
kitchen garden or house garden during an epidemic.</p>
<p>V. Articles of food should not be allowed to
remain uncovered on the table or elsewhere, for
there is chance of their infection by flies, mice, or
rats.</p>
<p>VI. Clothes received from the dhoby&rsquo;s house
should be again boiled in water, dried, and then
used.</p>
<p>VII. Bed-clothes and wearing apparel should
be aired and exposed to the sun daily. As frequently
as possible floors and passages should be
well washed with a disinfectant solution and then
well dried.</p>
<p>VIII. There should not be any over-crowding
in bed-rooms.</p>
<p>IX. Drinking water should be boiled before
use. Raw vegetables, such as salad, cucumber, &amp;c.,
should only be used after thoroughly washing them,
and then with vinegar.</p>
<p>X. Personal cleanliness should be strictly observed.
Daily bath, cleaning the teeth with carbolic
tooth powder, and carefully washing hands
and mouth before and after meals are essential.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>XI. Those who have to attend on plague cases
should be very careful. Hands should be thoroughly
washed with a disinfectant solution, and a nail
brush used soon after the patient or anything in
contact with him is touched. A bath to which some
antiseptic is added should be taken immediately after
coming in contact with plague patients. Workers
in plague hospitals should be warned about
scratches or wounds on their bodies. Use of respirators
with an antiseptic sprinkled over the entrance
valves is recommended. Only very healthy
people should approach plague cases. On the
appearance of slightest headache, languor, or fever
an attendant should be relieved from duty.</p>
<p>XII. As a prophylactic 5 grains of quinine sulphate
may be taken twice daily, or a small bottle
containing eucalyptus or some other volatile disinfectant,
may be carried in the pocket, and a few
drops may be occasionally poured on the handkerchief.
Smoking good tobacco may have a
prophylactic value.</p>
<p>XIII. If plague occurs in the house, the
following steps should be taken:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The patient should at once be put in bed
and kept in a temporary room, which may be put up
on the roof of a house. No healthy inmate of the
house should go in that room or have any connection
with the sick, except those who have to nurse the
patient.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) All discharges, f&aelig;ces, urine, sputum,
vomited matter, &amp;c., should be taken in vessels
with disinfectant solution in it, and some quicklime
should immediately be sprinkled over them. On no
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
account should anything leave the room but to be
disinfected.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Floor and bedsteads should be washed with
a disinfectant solution, clothes and other articles that
touch the patient should be carefully disinfected.
Crockery and glass should be scalded. If great
care and cleanliness are not observed with regard
to the bed and body linen of the patient, the infection
may be diffused through the air immediately
around the patient.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) A medical man should be at once sent for.
Delay is fatal.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>INOCULATION AGAINST PLAGUE.</i></span></h2>
<p>M. Haffkine, of cholera inoculation fame,
has commenced to inoculate against the plague
under the same principles on which his inoculation
against cholera is based. By injecting into the
body an attenuated virus of plague, a very mild
attack is produced, which in people inoculated has
proved harmless. This mild attack, it is thought,
would protect the system from more potent forms
of the poisonous germs. The inoculation for plague
is still in its experimental stage, and cannot, for
obvious reasons, be applied to a large population.
Medical attendants, nurses and others who, by call
of duty, have to constantly come in contact with
plague patients may, however, take advantage of this
means of protection, which, in the hands of M.
Haffkine, may yield good results. Yersin also
claims for his serum prophylactic value. In this and
all other matters connected with bacteriology, such
as germs, sero-therapeutics, &amp;c., the medical profession
now-a-days receives a good deal of satirical remarks
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
from sceptical lay public. It is natural that it
should be so, for the science of bacteriology is still
in its infancy, and many of its practical applications
are still in their experimental stage. But undoubtedly
the science is advancing, and by its aid we are
now better able to understand diseases and their
nature. Many facts have been demonstrated and
proved with precision. What is disbelieved to-day,
may, however, be believed tomorrow, for, with all
human attempt to reveal secrets of nature, such is the
case. Readers of Smollet&rsquo;s Roderick Random may
remember how in the Surgeon&rsquo;s Hall one of the examiners
said:&mdash;&ldquo;I affirm that all wounds of the
intestine whether great or small are mortal.&rdquo; Now,
however, if a man dies of a wound of the intestine,
the unfortunate doctor in whose hand such a casualty
takes place runs great risk of being charged with
malprax&egrave;s.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>TREATMENT.</i></span></h2>
<p>I. <i>Hygienic.</i>&mdash;The patient should take to bed
immediately on the appearance of the first symptoms.
The room should have means for free ventilation,
and the temperature in it should be between 60&deg; to
70&deg; F. The air of the room may be cooled by
a block of ice. The room should be kept clean, and
there must not be in it any curtain, carpet or hangings.
The floor and bedsteads should be daily washed
with a disinfectant solution. A position of absolute
rest in bed is to be maintained throughout the illness.</p>
<p>Bedpan and urinal should be always used. Bedclothes
should be light and warm. Wearing apparel
if saturated with perspiration should be changed.
It is best to have two beds side by side so as to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
able to move the patient easily from one to another
for cleansing purposes. Mattresses should be suitably
protected from penetration by the discharges. The
air of the sickroom can be made antiseptic by placing
pieces of blotting paper saturated with eucalyptus
oil or phenol on plates about the apartment or
by pouring carbolic acid on hot water in a plate.
The doorways should be curtained by a sheet wet
with disinfectant solution. Great cleanliness of the
body of the patient should be enforced by cold
sponging with an antiseptic solution. Skilful nursing
is essentially necessary. The motions should be
disinfected by strong antiseptics such as quicklime,
carbolic acid, &amp;c., as soon as they are passed.</p>
<p>II. <i>Dietetic.</i>&mdash;From the commencement of the
disease the diet should be liquid and nourishing.
Milk is best. The quantity for adults should not
be less than three or four pints in the twenty-four
hours. It must be given in small quantities at
short intervals. Soda, potash or plain carbonated
water may be mixed with it. Barley water and thin
sago water may also be given. If the patient&rsquo;s
vital powers are low, the milk may be peptonised
by using Fairchild&rsquo;s powders or by adding a little
of Benger&rsquo;s Liquor Pancreatices. In cases when
milk cannot be taken in sufficient amount, animal
food may be given in the form of plain meat broth.
Egg-flip with or without brandy may also be given.
It is useless to give strong meat essences when
the digestive powers are seriously impaired, and
excess of zeal in this direction does a great deal of
harm. These accumulate in the intestinal canal
and form a fermenting mixture in which poisonous
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
ptomaines form. Throughout the attack the patient&rsquo;s
strength should be husbanded as carefully as
possible. When there is thirst, water, or iced water,
or iced beer or stout, or ice-cream, or fruit <i>sherbat</i>
should be given. During convalescence great care
should be taken of diet, for then the vital powers
are at a very low ebb.</p>
<p>III. <i>External.</i>&mdash;In order to lower the temperature
rubbing of the skin with oil from the commencement
of the disease has been recommended,
but this procedure is, I think, of no use. I suggest,
however, that when temperature is high 15 drops
of Creosote may be rubbed near the axilla. During
height of fever, the body may be lightly sponged
all over, twice or thrice a day, with the following
solution:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Thymol </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l">40 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Spirit Lavendula </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l">2 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Spirit Vin. rectif. </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l">3 &rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Acid Acetic dil. </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l">3 &rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Aqu&aelig; Rose </td><td class="l">add </td><td class="l">16 &rdquo;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Mustard plasters to limbs and over the heart
should be given when there are signs of failing
heart and circulation, and over the epigastrium when
there is vomiting or hiccough. Smelling salts and
strong ammonia should be applied to the nostrils for
their restorative action. Blister over the nape of the
neck is useful when cerebral symptoms are present.
Ice caps over the head is very useful and should
be applied continuously. The enlarged glands may
be fomented with hot water or spongio-piline wrung
out of hot antiseptic solution. When they are
much painful, poppy or belladonna may be added
to the water. Belladonna with glycerine should be
applied in the beginning and iodine afterwards. Hot
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
corrosive sublimate fomentations are also useful. If
the glands suppurate, they should be opened aseptically
and dressed with antiseptics. Proper drainage
should be provided.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Internal.</i>&mdash;Knowing as we do that the
plague is due to the toxic products metabolized by
a pathogenic bacillus, the question comes&mdash;would an
antiseptic treatment be of any use? Can we by
any means induce an antiseptic action on the blood,
or have we any drug which can act as antitoxin?
It must be at once stated that no drug that has been
tried yet fulfils the above conditions. The claims
of quinine, however, should be taken into account.
This drug in small repeated doses acts as a general
antiseptic. I would, therefore, advocate its use especially
in the early stages. Plague is a disease in
which collapse sets in early and cardiac asthenia is
a very early complication. There is, therefore, great
urgency for early stimulation. Alcohol may be
given freely, but at the same time it must be remembered
that if the organs of elimination are not
acting properly, alcohol may do harm. For their
stimulant effects whiskey or iced champagne may
be given. Carbonate of ammonia or spirit ammonia
aromatic are held to be very useful stimulants in
plague cases. They may be given in combination
with cinchona, digitalis and ether. A prescription
like the following may be useful:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Ammonia Carb. </td><td class="l">5 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Chloric Ether </td><td class="l">20 minims.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Sulphuric Ether </td><td class="l">15 &rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Tint. Digitalis </td><td class="l">5 &rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Tint. Cinchona </td><td class="l">1 dram.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Aqu&aelig; Camphor </td><td class="l">1 ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">Every three hours.</span></td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>For cardiac asthenia, the following may be tried:&mdash;(1)
Caffeine, hypodermically, 5-grains dissolved
by the aid of 5 grains of Sodium Benzoate in 20
minims of warm distilled water and injected three
or four times a day if needful; (2) Ether or
ethereal solution of camphor hypodermically; (3)
Strychnine, hypodermically, beginning with gr. 1/60
every four or six hours till gr. 1/16 is injected, or
Liquor Strychnia in 5&mdash;10-minim doses every four
hours; (3) Musk may be given in 5-grain doses, or
as in the following mixture:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Pulv. Moschi </td><td class="l">10 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Mucilage Acacia </td><td class="l">2 drams.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Syr. Aurantii </td><td class="l">2 &rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Aqu&aelig; Camphor </td><td class="l">&frac12; ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">To be given every 6 hours.</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Digitalis does not always give good results, a
fact which Lowson attributes to some inflammatory
or fatty degenerative changes in the small vessels
giving rise to a tendency to h&aelig;morrhage. Stropanthus
may be substituted. Transfusion of blood a
hot saline solution and inhalation of oxygen have
been recommended for collapse. Dr. Viegas of
Bombay recommends Liquor Hydrasgyie Perchloride
10 to 15 minims every four hours if there is no
albumen in the urine. Dr. Dimmock has advised
subcutaneous injection of Guaicol 10 or 15 minims
every two hours. Permanganate of Potash 5 to 12
grains in 24 hours has also been recommended.
Dr. Blaney has recommended Medritina in two-dram
doses every two hours when the kidneys are
involved. Camphor has been recommended by
some as a cardiac stimulant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small"><i>TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMS.</i></span></h2>
<p>(1). High temperature may be reduced by
antipyretics, such as antipyrin, phenacetin, antifebrine,
&amp;c. These drugs produce profuse perspiration
and a certain amount of depression; it is,
therefore, advisable to restrict their use during the
first few hours only, and if not found responding,
they should be dropped altogether. Pyrexia is but
a sign of the intensity of the activities of the infective
agent, and by artificially reducing the body
heat we really do not lessen the virulence of the
poison, as shown by the rise of the temperature
again as soon as the action of the antipyretic subsides.
Hyperpyrexia itself is, however, an injurious
symptom, and when there is long continued high
temperature it is necessary to reduce it, either by an
antipyretic, quinine or cold bath, or cold sponging.
Cold bath is not suitable in plague patients on account
of the movement of the body which it entails,
and also on account of the serious cardiac depression
which accompanies the disease. Two grains of phenacetin
with 1 grain of hydrobromate of quinine is
a safe antipyretic. Brandy and tepid sponging are
also very useful.</p>
<p>(2). <i>Brain symptoms.</i>&mdash;For headache a mustard
plaster behind the upper part of the neck and
over the occiput. Ice cap or Lieter&rsquo;s tube or plain
water should be applied over the temples and scalp.
Nervine sedatives, such as Potassium Bromide, may
be given for insomnia when there is not much depression.
Otherwise full doses of alcohol may be
tried. Opium should not be used, but in mild cases,
without great depression, 10 to 20 minims of Liquor
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Opii sedativus with 30 minims of Sal Volatile in an
ounce of camphor water may be given to soothe
nervous unrest. For insomnia Lowson speaks
highly of Morpin&aelig; gr. 1/8 to gr. &frac12;. Hyoscine gr.
1/200 to gr. 1/75 may be tried. Meningites should be
treated by cold to the scalp and counter-irritation
to the nape of the neck and occiput.</p>
<p>(3). <i>H&aelig;morrhages</i> may be treated by Ergot
or Ergotin internally or hypodermically. When
there is much h&aelig;morrhage, use of alcohol should
be partly suspended.</p>
<p>(4). If there is constipation, a dose of calomel
may be given. In the beginning there is almost
always constipation, which should be removed by a
dose of calomel followed by a saline. Diarrh&oelig;a
may be checked by an enema of opium. Two grains
of Dover&rsquo;s powder and 10 grains of tannin mixed
with an ounce of gum mucilage and with two or
three ounces of warm water, arrowroot or starch
may be used for injection. Salol in 10-grain
doses every 4 hours may be given for diarrh&oelig;a.
For vomiting and hiccough sinapism over the
epigastrium, sucking of ice, and for thirst acidulated
water with syrup of lemon are recommended. Coma
must be promptly met by cold effusion if there is
pyrexia or by rectal injection of strong coffee.
The bladder of the patient should be carefully
watched. Pneumonia and other complications should
be treated under general principles.</p>
<p>When temperature falls and convalescence begins,
the stimulants should be lessened, and afterwards
a tonic with quinine, acid nitromuriatic dil.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
tincture calumba or quassia may be given with
infusion aurantii.</p>
<p><i>Serum treatment.</i>&mdash;The whole system of serum
therapeutics is due to the genius of Pasteur. Diphtheria
and tetanus are diseases that are caused by
specific germs and are now successfully treated by
immunised serum. Tetanus can be prevented and
even cured by the injection of serum of other animals
vaccinated against this disease: this process
has been applied by Yersin for producing a plague
serum, for which a prophylactic and curative power
is claimed, and this serum may be called plague antitoxin.
Yersin treated his first case in Canton. At
Amoy, the people were less averse to treatment,
and in 10 days he was able to treat 23 with two
deaths only. As yet Yersin&rsquo;s serum has been tried
in the declared diseases, but Yersin also proposes
to use it as a preventive. Haffkine also proposes
to make use of his serum for curative purpose.
Yersin&rsquo;s serum is older than Haffkine&rsquo;s, otherwise
bacteriologically they are identical. The subject
is in far too unsettled a condition at present, but
it has no doubt a hopeful future before it.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><i>DISINFECTION.</i></span></h2>
<p>Substances which can prevent infectious diseases
from spreading by destroying their specific
germs are called disinfectants. These disinfectants
can kill pathogenic germs. Heat is a most powerful
agent in killing-germs, therefore anything which is
subjected to prolonged boiling becomes sterile or
germ-free. For purification of clothes and bedding,
heat is the best agent, either by boiling them in
water or by placing them in a hot-air chamber. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
usual arrangement is a furnace with the smoke
shaft passing under or on one side of a brick chamber
and with a hot-air blast from a shaft running through
or under the fire into the chamber itself, or into a
passage below it, whence it passes into the chamber
through a valve; an exit for the hot-air is provided
at the top of the chamber, the clothes are suspended
in the chamber, at a little distance from the walls.
Various kinds of ingenious apparatus have been
recently contrived and are used. Steam disinfecting
chambers are necessary for the disinfection of
clothes, &amp;c., of a large population, and all large
towns and railway stations should have them. High
pressure steam in an apparatus contrived for the intermission
of its pressure is found to give the best
heat penetration to large non-conducting articles
such as bedding. Fumigation by burning sulphur
or chlorine is a very useful method for disinfection
of rooms. Large bonfires of sulphur may also
have a beneficial effect on the air.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small"><i>PURIFICATION OF A ROOM AFTER PLAGUE CASES</i>&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>All woodwork should be thoroughly cleansed
with soft soap and water, to which a little carbolic
acid has been added. The walls should be scraped
and then washed with hot lime to which carbolic
acid should be added in the proportion of one pint
to four gallons of water. Then the room should
be fumigated for 3 hours, with all doors and windows
and the chimney being closed, sulphur about 1
seer for every 100 cubic feet of space should be
put in a metallic dish, a little alcohol is poured on
it, and it is lighted. After 3 hours the doors and
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
windows should be opened and kept open for 24 or
36 hours. Rooms may be disinfected by chlorine.
Carbolic acid in 5 per cent. solution is useful for
all ordinary purposes, such as washing hands,
utensils, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Quicklime is the cheapest and the most easily
procurable disinfectant for drains and for disinfection
of discharges. Carbolic powder made by adding
carbolic acid to lime is very useful for the
disinfection of public latrines, drains and sewers.
Corrosive sublimate, in the proportion of 1 part
in 4,000, is the most efficient germicide known
and should be used diluted with water for sprinkling
on public roads and for flushing drains and
washing latrines, &amp;c. It is, however, poisonous and
corrodes metal drain pipes. In quarantine or isolation
camp the latrines should be of the dry earth
system. Carbolic acid powder should be largely
used in them. The question of suitable disposal of
sewage depends on the circumstances of each town
or village, but incineration is the most sanitary
method during an epidemic. Other disinfectants
too, such as Jey&rsquo;s Fluid, Creoline, Phenyle, Izal,
Sanitas, may also be used.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
